## üîÑ Updating the Site

### Automatic Deployments

Vercel automatically rebuilds and deploys when you push to GitHub:

```bash
# Make changes to your files
git add .
git commit -m "Update: description of changes"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will:
1. Detect the push to GitHub
2. Build the site (~1-2 min)
3. Deploy the new version
4. Update the live URL

### Deployment Status

Check deployment status:
- Visit your Vercel dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
- See build logs and deployment history
- Get notified of successful/failed builds

## üìù Content Updates

### Adding/Editing Content

Since you're using Content Collections, updating content is easy:

**Add a new prayer:**
```bash
# Create: src/content/prayers/new-prayer.md
---
title: New Prayer Title
author: "Bah√° ºu'll√°h"
category: General
tags:
  - peace
---

Prayer text here...
```

**Add a new event:**
```bash
# Create: src/content/events/new-event.json
{
  "title": "Event Title",
  "description": "Description",
  "startDateTime": "2025-12-01T19:00:00",
  "endDateTime": "2025-12-01T20:30:00",
  "location": "Location",
  "isPublic": true
}
```

Then commit and push:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add new prayer/event"
git push origin main
```

Site updates automatically in 1-2 minutes!

## üé® Custom Domain (Optional)

### Adding Your Own Domain

If you want `haringeybahai.org` instead of `haringeyweb.vercel.app`:

1. **Buy a domain** (Namecheap, Google Domains, etc.)
2. **In Vercel Dashboard**:
   - Go to your project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
   - Add your custom domain
   - Follow DNS configuration instructions
3. **Update DNS records** at your domain registrar
4. **Wait for propagation** (5-60 minutes)

Vercel automatically provisions SSL certificates for custom domains.

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Vercel

Check build logs in Vercel dashboard:

- Common issues: Missing dependencies, TypeScript errors
- Fix locally, test with `npm run build`, then push

### Site Not Updating

- Check Vercel dashboard for build status
- Verify Git push was successful: `git log origin/main`
- Clear browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R / Ctrl+Shift+R)

### Content Not Showing

- Verify content files in `src/content/` directory
