## Publishing Content

### Draft vs. Published

- **Draft**: Content is saved but NOT visible on the website
- **Published**: Content is live and visible to everyone

### Publishing Workflow

1. Create or edit your content
2. Set **Status** to **Draft** initially
3. Review your content carefully
4. When ready, change **Status** to **Published**
5. Click **✓** to save
6. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for the website to rebuild
7. Visit the live website to see your changes

### Automatic Website Updates

When you publish content:
1. Directus sends a signal to Vercel (the hosting service)
2. Vercel rebuilds the website (~1-2 minutes)
3. Your new content appears on the live site

**No need to do anything else!** The website updates automatically.

## Troubleshooting

### "Site is taking long to load"

**Problem**: Directus takes 30-60 seconds to wake up on first visit.

**Solution**: Wait patiently. This is normal for the free hosting tier. After the first load, it will be fast.

---

### "I saved changes but don't see them on the website"

**Problem**: Content is saved in Directus but not appearing on live site.

**Checklist**:
1. ✅ Is Status set to **Published**? (not Draft)
2. ✅ Did you wait 1-2 minutes for rebuild?
3. ✅ Did you hard-refresh the website? (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)
4. ✅ Are you looking at the correct page? (e.g., `/devotional/prayers`)

**Solution**: Check each item above. If still not working, contact the administrator.

---

### "I can't log in"

**Problem**: Email or password not working.

**Solution**: Contact the administrator to reset your password.

---

### "I accidentally deleted something"

**Problem**: Deleted content that should not have been deleted.

**Solution**: Contact the administrator immediately. Database backups can restore deleted content.

---

### "The website isn't updating after I publish"

**Problem**: Webhook may not be working.

**Checklist**:
1. ✅ Check Vercel dashboard for recent deployments
2. ✅ Look for failed builds

**Solution**: Contact the developer. The webhook connection may need to be fixed.

---

### "I made a mistake and already published"

**Problem**: Published content with errors.

**Solution**:
1. Go back to Directus
2. Edit the content and fix the error
3. Content is still set to "Published" - just save
4. Website will automatically rebuild with corrections
5. Wait 1-2 minutes and refresh
