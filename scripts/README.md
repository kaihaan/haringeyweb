node scripts/populate-bahai-events.js --year=2025

# 2026 only (183 B.E.)
node scripts/populate-bahai-events.js --year=2026
```

### Important Notes

#### Baháʼí Calendar
- The Baháʼí day begins and ends at **sunset**
- Naw-Rúz falls on the spring equinox (March 20 or 21)
- The calendar consists of 19 months of 19 days each
- Ayyám-i-Há provides the extra days needed to align with the solar year

#### Twin Birthdays (2026)
The Birth of the Báb and Birth of Bahá'u'lláh dates for 2026 are **calculated estimates** based on lunar patterns. These should be confirmed with official Baháʼí sources when the UK National Spiritual Assembly publishes the official calendar.

#### Duplicate Prevention
The script automatically checks for existing events with the same title and start date. Duplicate events will be skipped with a notification.

### Troubleshooting

#### Error: "DIRECTUS_URL and DIRECTUS_TOKEN must be set"
Ensure your `.env` file contains the required variables.

#### Error: "fetch failed" or timeout errors
Your Directus instance may be sleeping (if on Render free tier) or unavailable. Wait a moment and try again.

#### Events already exist
If you see "Already existing (skipped)" messages, those events are already in your Directus database. The script will not create duplicates.

### Event Structure

Each event created in Directus has the following structure:

```javascript
{
  status: 'published',
  title: 'Event Name',
  description: 'Detailed description...',
  start_datetime: '2025-03-20T18:00:00.000Z', // ISO 8601 format
  end_datetime: '2025-03-20T20:00:00.000Z',
  location: 'Venue TBD',
  is_public: true/false,
  category: 'Nineteen Day Feast' | 'Holy Day' | 'Special Event',
  is_recurring: false
}
```

### Data Sources

Event dates are based on:
- Official Baháʼí calendar from [bahai.org](https://www.bahai.org/action/devotional-life/calendar)
- UK Baháʼí Community calendar from [bahai.org.uk](https://www.bahai.org.uk/calendar)
- Calendar information from the Haringey Baháʼí Community (2023-24 reference)

### Future Updates

To update dates for future years:

1. Consult official Baháʼí calendars for the new year
2. Add a new year entry to the `BAHAI_EVENTS` object in the script
3. Update feast dates (add 19 days from Naw-Rúz)
4. Update holy day dates (especially Twin Birthdays which vary by lunar calendar)
5. Run the script with `--year=YYYY` to populate only the new year
