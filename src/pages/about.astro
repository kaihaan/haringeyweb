              <p>The Baháʼí Faith is a monotheistic religion founded in the 19th century by Baháʼu'lláh. It teaches that there is only one God who has progressively revealed His will through divine Messengers including Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, Christ, Muhammad, and most recently, the Báb and Baháʼu'lláh.</p>

              <p>Baháʼís believe that the essential purpose of religion is to promote the unity of the human race and to foster peace, justice, and prosperity for all people. The Faith has no clergy and is governed by democratically elected councils at the local, national, and international levels.</p>

          <ContentBlock
            content={`
              <p>The Baháʼí Faith was founded in Persia (modern-day Iran) in 1844 by the Báb, whose teachings prepared the way for Baháʼu'lláh. Despite severe persecution, the Faith spread throughout the Middle East.</p>

              <p>Baháʼu'lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, was imprisoned and exiled for His teachings. He spent the last 24 years of His life in the prison-city of Akká (in present-day Israel), where He wrote numerous letters to world leaders calling for peace and unity.</p>

              <p>After Baháʼu'lláh's passing in 1892, His son ʻAbdu'l-Bahá led the Faith and traveled extensively to promote its teachings. Today, the Baháʼí Faith has more than 5 million followers worldwide and is established in virtually every country.</p>
