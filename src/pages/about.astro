              <p>The Baháʼí Faith is a monotheistic religion founded in the 19th century by Baháʼu'lláh. It teaches that there is only one God who has progressively revealed His will through divine Messengers including Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Krishna, Zoroaster, Christ, Muhammad, and most recently, the Báb and Baháʼu'lláh.</p>

              <p>Baháʼís believe that the essential purpose of religion is to promote the unity of the human race and to foster peace, justice, and prosperity for all people. The Faith has no clergy and is governed by democratically elected councils at the local, national, and international levels.</p>

Yet this era also saw hope: the <strong>United Nations</strong> was founded (1945), implementing Bahá'u'lláh's vision of collective security. The <strong>decolonization movement</strong> freed dozens of nations in Africa and Asia. The <strong>Universal Declaration of Human Rights</strong> (1948) enshrined principles the Bahá'ís had long championed. Shoghi Effendi systematically built a global administrative order capable of uniting diverse peoples in this fractured world.</p></div><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> <em>What does 'unity without uniformity' mean in practice?

The world has grown both more interconnected and more fragmented. Environmental crises, economic inequality, and the search for meaning in a rapidly changing world have become defining challenges. Throughout, the Bahá'í community has worked at the grassroots—building capacity for service, advancing gender equality, promoting education, and fostering interfaith understanding. The vision of world unity is no longer utopian—it has become an urgent necessity.</p></div><p><strong>Reflection:</strong> <em>The story of the Bahá'í Faith is not confined to the past — it is the unfolding narrative of humanity's spiritual awakening.
